         <div> I established 'Theeones' my own Microsoft <br> 
            365 environment, specifically for ongoing <br>
            testing of services including Intune, Azure,

            and actively test Domain controllers and <br>
            server connections within my domain setup. <br>
            I've explored diverse laptop deployment <br>
            methods in Intune such as Autopilot and <br>
            auto enrollment, experimented with various <br>
            configurations, deployed applications, and <br>
            conducted extensive trials with iPhone and <br>
            Mac deployments using personal devices. <br>
            Additionally, in Azure, I've successfully <br>
            provisioned Virtual Machines, managed <br>
            them remotely for command execution, and <br>
            hosted test environments.
